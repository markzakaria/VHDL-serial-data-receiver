# VHDL-serial-data-receiver
It contains a serial data input, a parallel data output, data(6:0), a clock signal, two supervision signals generated by the circuit:  (error) and (data valid). The input data train consists of ten bits. A  new bit is received at the rising edge of the clock. The first bit is a start bit, which,  when high, must cause the circuit to operate.
