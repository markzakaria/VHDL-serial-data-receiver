# VHDL-serial-data-receiver
It contains a serial data input, a parallel data output, data(6:0), a clock signal, two supervision signals generated by the circuit:  (error) and (data valid). The input data train consists of ten bits. A  new bit is received at the rising edge of the clock. The first bit is a start bit, which,  when high, must cause the circuit to operate. After starting receiving data. The next seven are the actual data bits. The ninth bit is a parity bit, whose status must be ‘0’ if the number of ones in data is even or ‘1’ otherwise. Finally, the tenth is a stop bit, which must be high if the transmission is correct. An error is detected when either the parity does not check or the stop bit is not a ‘1’. When reception is finished and if no error has been detected, then the data stored in the internal registers is transferred to the output data(6:0) and the output data_valid output is ‘1’.
